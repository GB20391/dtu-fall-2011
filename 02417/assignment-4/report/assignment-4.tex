\maketitle

In this report models describing the heat consumption in the VEKS system are
build. As data for the models, a year of hourly measurements of the heat
consumption along with various climate variables are given. First a simple
model, based only on the heat consumption measurements, is build. Then a more
complex model that incorporates information from the climate data is build. For
both models 1- and 6-hour predictions of the heat consumption are made and the
performance is checked by comparing the predictions with the actual values.

\section*{Building the simple model}

In the simple model only the data of past heat consumption is used. First the
data is plotted and shown in figure~\ref{fig:hc-ts}.

From the plot an upward trend is seen and high frequency oscillations are also
noticed. To further investigate the data the \acf\ and the \pacf\ for the heat
consumption series are plotted and shown in figure~\ref{fig:hc-acfs}.
